# Flight Price Prediction Web Application with Flask and Machine Learning


This project demonstrates a comprehensive Flask web application for predicting flight prices, leveraging machine learning for accurate estimations. The application showcases a seamless integration of web development, database interactions, and model deployment.

## Project Overview

This repository encapsulates the development journey of a Flask-based flight price prediction tool. It guides you through 8 distinct phases, each building upon the previous one to create a fully functional and deployable web application.

### Project Structure

**Phase 1: Introduction to Flask**

* Setting up the Flask environment
* Understanding core Flask concepts
* Building a basic Flask application structure

**Phase 2: Dynamic URLs and Routing**

* Implementing flexible URL routing
* Creating dynamic URLs for flight searches
* Handling user input for price prediction

**Phase 3: HTML Templates and Jinja2**

* Designing user interfaces with HTML templates
* Utilizing Jinja2 for dynamic content rendering
* Displaying flight search results and price predictions

**Phase 4: Web Forms and Input Validation**

* Creating user-friendly forms for flight searches
* Validating user input to ensure data integrity
* Preventing invalid or malicious inputs

**Phase 5: Databases with Flask and SQLAlchemy**

* Integrating SQLAlchemy for database interactions
* Storing flight data and price predictions
* Managing data persistence and retrieval

**Phase 6: Persistent State Management**

* Implementing techniques for maintaining user state
* Handling sessions or other state management mechanisms
* Ensuring smooth user experiences across interactions

**Phase 7: Cookies for User Tracking (Optional)**

* Exploring the use of cookies for user personalization
* Tracking user preferences and behavior (if applicable)

**Phase 8: Training and Deployment of ML Model**

* Training a machine learning model for price prediction
* Integrating the model into the Flask application
* Creating an API endpoint for price prediction requests
* Deploying the application for real-world use
